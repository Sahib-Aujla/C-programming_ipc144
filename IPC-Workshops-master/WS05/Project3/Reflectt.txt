1.With the help of user-defined datatypes,we can easily understand our code. We do not need 
to memorise a lot of variables. Our code becomes maintainable and easily debugged. We can 
change anything related to variables in much less time. For example, In this workshop I created
 two userdefined datatypes gameinfo and playerinfo. Both of them contained members of int and 
char datatype. They could be accesed easily  by me and I could change their values at any point
 without having trouble of remembering so many variables.With the help of intellisense it become 
even more easy.I initialised playerinfo with p1 variable and gameinfo with g1.Further I initialised
 the members and accesed them using p1.membername or g1.membername value.
2.To store the end results as well I would have created another structure with name endresult.This
 structure will have all the information about the result came at the end of the game i.e, number 
of moves remaining, treasure found and number of lives left. I will have created this three members
 of int datatype and printed the end result at the last using printf statement.
3.For me the most difficult part of the workshop was  printing the symbol character that signified 
the current position of the player. I faced alot of problems in tackling it. At first, I could not
 print it at right position.Once I did it , then I had to print only space in the first iteration of
 the loop. But finally, I got an idea. I used the if statement after the for loop to print symbol 
character in the second iteration of the big for loop with the condition that i shouls not be equal
 to g1.moves. This way , I could print it correctly.
